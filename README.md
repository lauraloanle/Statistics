# Statistics - the science of learning from data

Thank for learning and practicing Statistics, I know how to use the proper methods to collect the data, employ the correct analyses, and effectively present the results. 
Statistics is a crucial process behind how we make discoveries in science, make decisions based on data, and make predictions. Statistics is the way to understand a subject much more deeply.

I save all my works on statistics here.
